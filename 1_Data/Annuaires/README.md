# Annuaires Dataset

Here can be found all the annuaires pages dataset prepared and segmented.

The goal was to recreate a small dataset of 50 images which could represent the "Annuaire des propri√©taires". Published in 1898, it lists, for all the adresses of the french capital, their owners. The dataset is constructed as each letter have at least all two pages representing themselves. 

- **images**: contains the ipages in their png or jpg format
- **page_Transkribus**: contains the PageXML export done from Transkribus in order to migrate to eScriptorium
- **page_transforme**: contains the PageXML obtained after its transformation by the script done [here](https://github.com/Heresta/BAO_Stage_DH_ENS_2021/tree/main/CorrectionPageXMLeScriptorium) in order for eScriptorium to display the manual corrections done on the transcriptions
- **alto_eScriptorium**: contains the ouput of eScriptorium in ALTO4 format.
